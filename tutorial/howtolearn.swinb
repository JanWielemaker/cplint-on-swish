# How to perform learning

*cplint on SWISH* contains two learning algorithm:
- EMBLEM (EM over Bdds for probabilistic Logic programs Efficient Mining): an implementation of EM for learning parameters that computes expectations directly on BDDs [1,2,3]
- SLIPCOVER (Structure LearnIng of Probabilistic logic programs by searChing OVER the clause space): an algorithm for learning the structure of programs by searching the clause space and the theory space separately [4]

*Note*: the learning algorithms are available only if you use the Prolog editor.

## Input source
To execute a learning algorithm the input source must be divided in five parts:
- preamble,
- background knowledge, i.e., knowledge valid for all interpretations
- LPAD/CPL-program for you which you want to learn the parameters (optional)
- language bias information
- example interpretations

### Preamble
In order to perform either EMBLEM or SLIPCOVER you need to import the library =slipcover= with the command
</div>

<div class="nb-cell program prolog">
:- use_module(library(slipcover)).
</div>

<div class="nb-cell markdown">
After that you have to initialize =slipcover= with the command
</div>

<div class="nb-cell program prolog">
:- sc.
</div>

<div class="nb-cell markdown">
At this point you can start setting parameters for SLIPCOVER with the predicate set_sc/2. For the complete list of the available parameters see the manual *Help*->*Help on cplint*.

### Background knowledge
Now you can specify the background knowledge with a fact of the form
==
bg(<list of terms representing clauses>).
== 
Alternatively, you can specify a set of clauses by including them in a section between the goals =|
